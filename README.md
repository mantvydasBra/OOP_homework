# OOP_homework
Homework which was created by my classmate.
Simple program in C# which uses SQL server for its information keeping. The program works like this:
* Student logs in and can see his exams and grades.
* Admin logs in and can add new student accounts (set their ID, Name, Password, Surname and up to 5 exams)

# Layout
There are multiple different screens. First one is login screen.

The username by default is: <ins>Admin</ins> and Password is: <ins>test123</ins>
Also another preset account: <ins>Jonas</ins> and <ins>1234</ins>

User interface:

Personal ID can only be 11 symbols (Lithuania standart). Only 2-5 exams can be picked, because of the rules.

User list contains all the users, which can be individually double clicked and last screet opens, which lets set the grades.
All exams must have a value in here.
